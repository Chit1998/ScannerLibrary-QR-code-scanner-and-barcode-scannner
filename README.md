```gradle
dependencyResolutionManagement {
    repositories {
        google()
        mavenCentral()
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
}
```

## Then add dependency:
```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation("com.github.Chit1998:ScannerLibrary-QR-code-scanner-and-barcode-scannner:1.0.1")
}
```
## 1. Declare permission in your AndroidManifest.xml
```gradle
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />
```

## 2. Start scanner from your Activity
```gradle
Scanner.start(
    this,
    cameraTime = 30_000,          // auto-close after 30 sec
    visibilityFlash = true,       // enable flash toggle
    cameraFacing = Scanner.CameraFacing.BACK
)
```

## 3. Handle result
```gradle
override fun onActivityResult(requestCode: Int, resultCode: Int, data: Intent?) {
    super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data)
    if (requestCode == Scanner.REQUEST_CODE && data != null) {
        val scannedText = data.getStringExtra(Scanner.EXTRA_RESULT)
        Toast.makeText(this, "Scanned: $scannedText", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show()
    }
}
```
